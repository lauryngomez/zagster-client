        <h2> About </h2>

        <p> This is a visualization that shows the frequency of each route taken from station-to-station using the Zagster Bike Share system in Bend, OR. </p>
        <p> I pulled the data from herokuapp.com and I used chartjs.org to create the chart visualization. The data being pulled is about the routes from each station. In the end I only ended up using data from the GRC station because it was too much to use data from all 8 stations. </p>
